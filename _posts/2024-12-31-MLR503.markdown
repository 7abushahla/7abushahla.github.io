This was my MLR503: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Course Research Project. We developed an end-to-end deep learning-based handwritten text recognition (HTR) system for Arabic script leveraging the KHATT Dataset. To further enhance recognition accuracy, we incorporated KenLM for post-processing.
