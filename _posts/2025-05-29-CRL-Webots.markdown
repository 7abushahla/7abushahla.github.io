This project implements a Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework for mobile robot navigation using the e-puck robot in Webots. We design a unified agent trained sequentially across multiple tasks—maze navigation, line following, and obstacle avoidance—using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). The setup evaluates the agent’s ability to learn new behaviors while retaining previously acquired skills.
