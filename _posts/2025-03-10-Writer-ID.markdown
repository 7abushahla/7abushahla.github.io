In this work, we manually verified and labeled a substantial chunk of the public portion of the Muharaf dataset, enhancing its applicability for supervised learning and writer identification. We developed an end-to-end CNN-based DL system with attention mechanisms for line-level writer identification in historical Arabic handwritten manuscripts using this labeled Muharaf Dataset, accommodating up to two authors per line.
