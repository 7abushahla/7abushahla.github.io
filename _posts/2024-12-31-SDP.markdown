This was my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering Senior Design Project, focused on spectrum sensing and allocation using a low-complexity deep learning-based (CNN) spectrum sensing algorithm. The project involved developing and quantizing the CNN model, which was deployed on hardware for real-time operation. The solution was demonstrated both in simulation and on hardware, utilizing a Raspberry Pi as the central node, RTL-SDR for signal sensing, and LoRa transceivers for communication. This dual demonstration validated the practicality and efficiency of the approach in addressing dynamic spectrum management challenges.
